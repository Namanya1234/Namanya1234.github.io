                    <p>
                        Hello my name is Rafa Maheswara Putra Rukmanto. I am a 5th semester student studyin for a
                        Computer Science degree under JIC Western Michigan Program.
                        I am 17 years old thiis year and have been learning about code since grade 6 when i first
                        learned HTML and more recently learned more about javascript, css and python.
                        I have a history of getting different medals at Math Olympiads namely SASMO silver medals as
                        well as bronze medals for SIMOC exam portion and IJMO in 2018 in Singapore and Thailand
                        respectively. I also got 9th place in the 2019 Mathlathone.
                        I currently enjoy solving Rubik's cubes namely the Square-1 and 3x3 cube one handed. I have
                        gotten two sub world record times on a 2x2 being 0.46 and 0.38.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am currently enjoying my stay at JIC since all the teachers are wolcoming and all the course
                        materials are very easy to process and have never been overwhelmed by them unless I forgot to
                        prepare for an exam.
                        I do plan on going into software development namely games because it seems the most interesting
                        to me so I do intend to work on my 3d designing skills and drawing skills since I hope to be
                        able to make an Indie game on the side even if I don't get a Game Developing job.
                        My other preferred option would be designing management systems/information systems since I have
                        had very many inconveniences when it comes to proper information sharing.

                    </p>
                    <p>Thanks for taking a look at this project and hope you will for many more</p>
